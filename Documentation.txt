Description about the code:


 I have got the rows and columns in the string and passenger id in array.
Then, I had initialize a List of Arrays with zero according to rows and columns.
Based on the priority the passenger id is separated in to prime numbers,power of two and least priority numbers.
Separate code is written for the prime number and power of two.
Then the output is created to display all the values to zero.I tried to complete the code. However, I am not able to finish it.
